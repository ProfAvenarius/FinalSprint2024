Final Sprint projects for 2nd semester software development program.
Both are react js, created with vite on vs code and tested on Chrome.

First Catch is a second version -html/js refactored into react/jsx uses node js 
to run a server on port 5000 json to create a mock api to allow the storage of data.
Open the firstcatch directory, install node modules, npm rundev and npm run server.
First Catch is a portal that allows Fishers to post their catch and the public to
buy.  It uses a map api from leaflet to allow a map to serve as a location input.

Portfolio is the first version of a personal portfolio page that uses a infinite 
scroll effect from the React Three and drei libraries for 3D web designs.  THe 
project became a study for other 3D features such as mesh geometries and lighting 
effects. THe general style and layout are completed, now more contact is required.
